Frequently asked questions
**************************

My signature is not validated by other implementations. What is wrong?

     Try to reverse it (like "sign[::-1]" in Python).  Try to swap its
     halves ("sign[len(sign)/2:] + sign[:len(sign)/2]").  Try to reverse
     its swapped halves too.

     It is GOST: do you expect serialization unification?!

My signature is *still* not validated by other implementations!

     Try to reverse digest you are signing/verifying (like "dgst[::-1]"
     in Python).

Everything above did not help me. Does GoGOST sucks?

     No way!  You still have not tried to reverse your binary private
     key, public key and swap its halves.
